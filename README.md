# Kupujem Prodajem Test

## Get Started

1. Clone this repository on your computer
2. Navigate to the project's root directory and run the following command to set up your development environment:
```
ddev setup
```
This command sets up the development environment for the project, including creating the necessary database tables (`user` and `user_log`) if they don't already exist. If the tables already exist, only `ddev start` will be executed.

You can access the project at [http://kupujem-prodajem.ddev.site/](http://kupujem-prodajem.ddev.site/).
